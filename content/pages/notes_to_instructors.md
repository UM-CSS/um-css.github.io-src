Title: Notes to Instructors
Slug: instructor-notes
Summary: Notes to instructors

### In general
We recommend that instructors, ourselves included, read the instructions and try each lab several weeks before assigning it to students. It may be that they need some setup, as with the Experiments Lab, and starting early will allow time for that. Additionally, the packages and software these labs are built with may change over time. This could break some functionality and require changes to the code.

### In specific
Many of the labs have specific notes for how to run them, or problems that might be encountered, in the `README.md` file on their github repository. It is recommended that instructors go through these before assigning the lab to students.
