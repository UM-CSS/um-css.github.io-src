Summary: Technical and setup informaiton for the course


## Using Azure Notebooks
We have made up a quick [guide to using Azure Notebooks]({static}/pdfs/Azure_Guide.pdf) for students in the class.

## Using Jupyter
Jupyter has an excellent introductory user guide for [notebook basics](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb).

## Installation
In this class, we will be using Azure Notebooks, where installation is already done for us. You can also run all of this course's code and tools on your own computer. The software is all free and open source. The best way to do so is to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution). Anaconda (`conda` for short) will install all the necessary materials and make sure they work well together. (NB: It is best not to mix `conda` with other systems, like `pip`. They will each make changes to the system without telling the other, and this can result in inconsistent/incompatable packages and a big headache. Simply put, using more than one package manager is having too many chefs in the kitchen.)
